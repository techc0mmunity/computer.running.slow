There are various factors that can cause a slow PC. Your operating system has to manage the resources of your computer (memory, drive space, processing power) between all the programs that are running on it, so there are a huge number of things that may be reducing your computer’s performance. Main causes of a slow computer usually boil down to your PC’s resources being used inefficiently.

_Here are some of the things that may have caused your computer to become so slow:_

* Running out of RAM (Random Access Memory)
* Running out of disk drive space (HDD or SSD)
* Old or fragmented hard drive
* Too many background programs
* Too many startup programs
* Falling behind on Windows or driver updates
* Malware or viruses
* Special effects and visual features

## How to make your computer faster?

If your computer speed is not what it should be, the first thing to try is restarting your computer.

Your operating system allocates space in RAM for programs as they run on your computer. Your RAM will eventually fill up, which will slow down your computer as your operating system starts using the swap file instead.

The swap file is a file on your disk drive that your operating system uses for data that is currently being used by programs, when your RAM, which is normally used for that purpose, runs out of space. Since hard drives and even the much faster SSD’s are slower than RAM, your computer will slow down significantly when it resorts to using the swap file.

Simply closing programs that are running on your computer helps, but restarting your computer allows it to be refreshed in a number of other ways as well. It ensures programs won’t keep running on the background (scroll down for more about background programs), allows Windows updates to be installed, and can fix a number of bugs that you might be suffering from, such as memory leaks, which cause programs to eat up much more RAM than they should.

If you notice applications starting up automatically after you have restarted your computer, your PC performance might be suffering from startup programs. Scroll down to the startup program section of this guide to learn more about them and how you can stop them from slowing down your computer.
